White-box Cartoonization
This repository contains a Python script for applying a white-box cartoonization effect to webcam input using TensorFlow. 
The cartoonization effect is achieved through the utilization of a pre-trained deep learning model.

# Prerequisites
Python (3.6)
TensorFlow (1.15.2)
OpenCV (3.4.18.65)
NumPy (1.19.5)
tqdm (4.64.1) {optional}

# Usage
Run the cartoonize_webcam.py script to apply the cartoonization effect to your webcam input. 
Press 'q' to quit the application.

# Notes
The cartoonize function in the script performs the cartoonization process. You can also use this function in your own scripts by providing a suitable input image.
The script utilizes a TensorFlow model for cartoonization, and the model checkpoints need to be downloaded and placed in the saved_models directory for the script to work properly.
Feel free to explore and modify the code to suit your needs. If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for improvement, please create an issue or pull request.

Happy cartoonizing! ðŸŽ¨
